## Self Introduction

Thank you for visiting my website. This page was created for Assignment #4 for DACSS 604. 

I am currently a graduate student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Program, also known as DACSS, at the University of Massachusetts- Amherst. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology, with a minor in Anthropology, from Mount Holyoke College. For over a decade, I have been working for state agencies, and I am currently employed full-time as an employee for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. My academic background has given me a foundation in understanding human behavior, which I am now complementing with data analytics skills to improve decision-making processes.
